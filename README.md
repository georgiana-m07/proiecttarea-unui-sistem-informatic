# Dental Clinic Management System - PSI Project

This project was developed for the "Informatic Systems Design / Proiectarea Sistemelor Informaționale" (PSI) course. It focuses on creating an information system for tracking dental procedures and managing clinic operations. The project includes planning, database design, system interfaces, and security considerations, following the entire development lifecycle.

## Project Overview

The system supports the operations of a dental clinic, covering everything from scheduling appointments to processing invoices. It includes a detailed design phase, encompassing user interfaces, database structures, input and output forms, and security protocols. The project also accounts for software package evaluations and risk management strategies.

### Key Features:
- **Patient Management**: The system keeps detailed records of each patient's visit, treatments, and health history.
- **Material and Supplier Management**: The system tracks materials used in treatments and manages orders from suppliers.
- **System Outputs**: Generates patient forms, treatment reports, prescriptions, referrals, and invoices.
- **Security**: Implements user roles and encrypted access to ensure sensitive patient data is protected.

## 2. Evaluation of Software Packages

Several software solutions, including **Dentrix**, **EagleSoft**, and **Open Dental**, were evaluated based on compatibility, ease of use, and security. **Open Dental** was chosen based on a comprehensive evaluation grid, which scored each software on criteria such as:
- **System Compatibility**
- **Modularity**
- **Ease of Use**
- **Security Measures**

## 3. System Design

The system design focused on both the **outputs** (forms and reports generated by the system) and **inputs** (data entered by the users).

### 3.1 System Outputs
The system generates various forms and reports:
- **S1 - Patient Form**: For registering and updating patient details.
- **S2 - Dental Treatment Form**: For recording treatments and procedures.
- **S5 - Prescription Form**: For issuing prescriptions to patients.
- **S9 - Invoice Form**: For billing patients and tracking payments.

#### Screenshot:
- **Patient Form (Figure 3: Patient Form)**: An example of the patient registration form generated by the system. Found in **section 4.1**.
- **Invoice Form (Figure 4: Invoice)**: Generated invoice for dental services. Found in **section S11**.

### 3.2 System Inputs
The system allows for user input in various areas, including:
- **I1 - Material Supplier Invoices**: For tracking materials purchased for procedures.
- **I5 - Patient Medical Records**: For entering and updating patient health data.
- **I8 - Appointment Scheduling**: For managing and updating patient appointments.

#### Screenshot:
- **Input Form (Figure 5: Input Form)**: A sample of a form used to input patient or appointment data into the system. Found in **section 4.2**.

### 3.3 User Interface Design
The system’s user interface is designed for ease of use, featuring:
- **Appointment Scheduling Interface**: A calendar-based system for managing patient appointments.
- **Patient Records Management**: A detailed interface for viewing and updating patient medical histories.
- **Material Tracking**: An interface to track dental materials and order statuses.

## 4. Database Design

The database design is at the core of the system, ensuring that all patient, treatment, material, and financial data is stored, retrieved, and processed securely. The database includes several key tables and relationships that allow the clinic to operate efficiently.

### 4.1 Database Tables
Key tables within the database include:
- **Patients**: Stores personal and medical information about each patient.
- **Appointments**: Tracks patient appointments with detailed records of each visit.
- **Treatments**: Stores information on dental procedures performed on patients.
- **Materials**: Tracks dental materials in stock, supplier details, and inventory.
- **Invoices**: Handles the financial transactions and billing information.

### 4.2 Relationships Between Tables
The relationships between these tables ensure that data integrity is maintained across the system. For example, each appointment is linked to a patient and potentially multiple treatments, while invoices are connected to both treatments and materials used.

## 5. Security Design

The system was designed with multiple layers of security to protect sensitive patient data and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

### 5.1 Role-based Access Control
Different levels of access are granted based on the user’s role. For example, administrative staff may have read-only access to medical records, while dentists have full access to update and modify them.

### 5.2 Encryption
All passwords and sensitive information are stored using SHA-256 encryption to ensure data security. Additionally, encryption protocols are applied during data transmission between the server and user interfaces.

### 5.3 Activity Logging
All user actions are logged to maintain an audit trail, which can be reviewed in case of unauthorized access attempts or system issues.

## 6. Testing and Implementation

Before going live, the system underwent thorough testing to ensure its reliability, performance, and security.

### 6.1 Unit Testing
Each component of the system, such as individual forms and database queries, was tested independently to ensure they function as expected.

### 6.2 Integration Testing
Testing was performed to ensure that all components of the system, such as the front-end, database, and external APIs, worked together seamlessly.

### 6.3 System Testing
System-wide testing was conducted to assess performance under realistic conditions, as well as to check for vulnerabilities and ensure security features worked correctly.

## 7. Implementation

The implementation of the system was broken down into several phases to ensure that each part of the system was properly integrated, tested, and deployed in a real-world environment.

### 7.1 System Deployment

The deployment phase was carried out after the system passed all testing phases, ensuring the system is fully operational in a production environment. The steps included:

- **Database Setup**: The SQL Server database was deployed on a secure, cloud-hosted server, accessible only by authorized personnel.
- **Application Installation**: The front-end application was installed on the clinic's local network, allowing users to interact with the system from any workstation within the clinic.
- **User Training**: Key clinic staff were trained on how to use the system for scheduling appointments, entering patient data, and generating reports.

### 7.2 System Maintenance

Post-deployment, a maintenance plan was implemented to ensure the system remains up-to-date and performs well over time. This included:

- **Regular Backups**: Automated backups of the database were scheduled daily to ensure data is preserved in the event of hardware failure or data corruption.
- **System Updates**: The system was set up to receive periodic updates, which include bug fixes, security patches, and feature enhancements.
- **User Support**: A dedicated support team was made available for clinic staff to report any issues, request new features, or receive additional training.
