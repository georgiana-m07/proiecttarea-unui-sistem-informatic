# Dental Clinic Management System - PSI Project

This project was developed for the "Informatic Systems Design / Proiectarea Sistemelor Informaționale" (PSI) course. It focuses on creating an information system for tracking dental procedures and managing clinic operations. The project includes planning, database design, system interfaces, and security considerations, following the entire development lifecycle.

## Project Overview

The system supports the operations of a dental clinic, covering everything from scheduling appointments to processing invoices. It includes a detailed design phase, encompassing user interfaces, database structures, input and output forms, and security protocols. The project also accounts for software package evaluations and risk management strategies.

### Key Features:
- **Patient Management**: The system keeps detailed records of each patient's visit, treatments, and health history.
- **Material and Supplier Management**: The system tracks materials used in treatments and manages orders from suppliers.
- **System Outputs**: Generates patient forms, treatment reports, prescriptions, referrals, and invoices.
- **Security**: Implements user roles and encrypted access to ensure sensitive patient data is protected.

## Project Structure and Components:

### 1. Project Planning

The project’s development was planned using Gantt charts for timeline management, and various roles were assigned to handle specific aspects:
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Ensured that the project was on track, monitored risk, and addressed user resistance.
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Ensured that the system was thoroughly tested and met all specified requirements.
- **Programmer (PRG)**: Developed the system code.
- **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Designed and managed the database for the system.
- **Designer (DSG)**: Created the UI/UX design, ensuring the system was user-friendly.

### 2. Evaluation of Software Packages

Several software packages, including **Dentrix**, **EagleSoft**, and **Open Dental**, were evaluated based on their suitability for managing the clinic’s operations. The evaluation criteria included:
- **Compatibility**: Whether the software could integrate with existing tools.
- **Ease of use**: How easily the clinic staff could learn and use the software.
- **Security**: The robustness of security measures for protecting sensitive patient data.

A scoring grid was used to compare these software packages, and **Open Dental** was selected as the most suitable option based on its overall score.

#### Screenshot:

### 3. System Outputs

The system generates multiple forms and documents, including:
- **Patient Forms**: For registering and tracking patient details.
- **Treatment Forms**: For documenting dental procedures.
- **Invoices**: For billing dental services.
- **Medical Referrals and Prescriptions**: Generated for sending patients to specialists or prescribing medication.

#### Screenshots:
- **Patient Form (Figure: Patient Form)**: Example of a patient registration form generated by the system, found in **section 4.1**.
- **Invoice Form (Figure: Invoice)**: Example of a generated invoice for dental services, located in **section S11**.
- **Prescription Form (Figure: Prescription)**: A generated prescription document for patient medications, found in **section S5**.

### 4. Database Design

The database structure is a key part of the system, managing all the information related to patients, appointments, materials, and financial records. The database includes the following tables:
- **Patients**: Stores patient details, including contact information, medical history, and appointments.
- **Appointments**: Tracks when patients are scheduled for treatments, including the details of the procedure.
- **Materials**: Manages the materials used for dental treatments, including quantity and supplier information.
- **Invoices**: Handles billing and payment tracking for services rendered.

#### Screenshot:
- **ER Diagram (Figure: ER Diagram)**: The Entity-Relationship diagram shows the relationships between key entities like `Patients`, `Appointments`, `Materials`, and `Invoices`. This can be found in **section 4.4**.

### 5. User Interface Design

The system’s interface was designed with user-friendliness in mind. The main features include:
- **Appointment Scheduling**: A visual calendar interface for scheduling patient appointments.
- **Patient Records**: A detailed patient profile page that tracks all medical history and treatments.
- **Material Tracking**: Interface for managing dental supplies, including order status and inventory levels.

Mockups and wireframes were created to guide the development process.

#### Screenshot:
- **UI Mockup (Figure: UI Mockup)**: Include a mockup showing the interface for managing patient appointments and records, which can be found in **section 4.3**.

### 6. System Inputs

The system allows for the input of various forms, including:
- **Invoices from Suppliers**: Input related to material purchases.
- **Patient Medical Records**: Input fields for medical history, diagnosis, and prescribed treatments.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Allows users to input and modify patient appointments.

#### Screenshot:
- **Input Forms (Figure: Input Forms)**: Show an example of a form used to input patient details or schedule an appointment, located in **section 4.2**.

---

### 7. Security Design

The system implements multiple layers of security:
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admins have full access, while standard users (e.g., receptionists) have limited access to patient data.
- **Encryption**: User passwords are stored using SHA-256 encryption.
- **Activity Logging**: Tracks user actions such as logins, data edits, and appointment changes for auditing purposes.

#### Screenshot:
- **Security Model (Figure: Security Model)**: A diagram showing the system’s role-based access controls and encryption methods, found in **section 4.6**.

---

### 8. Testing and Implementation

The system underwent multiple phases of testing:
- **Unit Testing**: Each component (e.g., forms, database queries) was tested in isolation to ensure correctness.
- **Integration Testing**: Components were tested together to verify that they interact as expected.
- **System Testing**: The full system was tested for performance, security, and usability.

#### Screenshot:
- **Test Reports (Figure: Test Report)**: Include a test report that highlights the results of unit and system testing, located in **section 5.1**.

## Technologies Used

The project involved a variety of technologies and tools throughout its development:
- **Microsoft Visio**: Used for creating flowcharts, ER diagrams, and UI mockups.
- **SQL Server / MySQL**: For database design and management.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For creating the user interface.
- **MS Project**: Used for project planning and managing tasks via Gantt charts.
- **JSON/XML**: For data exchange in reports, such as prescriptions and invoices.
